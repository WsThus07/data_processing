# Data Processing Projects

This repository contains two projects for processing image and audio data. Each project is located in its respective directory.

## Image Processing Project

The image processing project focuses on various tasks related to image analysis, manipulation, and computer vision. It includes the following files:

- `image_processing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that performs basic image processing operations such as resizing, cropping, and applying filters.
- `*.png and *.jpeg`:sample images for testing the image processing algorithms.

To run the image processing project, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed and execute the Python scripts or Jupyter Notebook as needed.

## Audio Processing Project

The audio processing project deals with tasks related to audio analysis, signal processing, and audio feature extraction. It includes the following files:

- `audio_processing.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that applies various audio processing techniques such as filtering, spectral analysis, and waveform visualization .
- `*.wav`: audio files used for testing the audio processing algorithms.

To run the audio processing project, ensure that the required libraries and dependencies are installed, and execute the Python scripts or Jupyter Notebook as necessary.

## Getting Started

To get started with each project, follow the instructions in their respective directories. Make sure you have the necessary dependencies and data files available. Feel free to explore and modify the code to suit your specific needs.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or new ideas for either of the projects, please submit a pull request. Please ensure that your contributions adhere to the project's coding style and guidelines.
